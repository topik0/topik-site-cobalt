export const AboutBio = `I have had an interest in computers and technology for as long as I can remember.  I started programming with frontend work and have stuck with that mostly since.  I've made many static sites, and a couple serious webapps.  Linux and open source software is another thing I love.  Having absolute freedom over one's device is something that I value.  I use Fedora Linux daily on one of my machines.  Computer hardware is another one of my interests.  The pace that modern hardware is progressing at is baffling to me.  I like many things and I'd love to chat about it with you, so feel free to join my Discord server in the Links section`
